# Friday AI 🤖✨

**Friday AI** – Your Intelligent Personal Assistant  
_A living AI project inspired by Iron Man’s FRIDAY, designed to evolve from a voice assistant to a multimodal, autonomous, cross-platform AI._

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

Friday is more than just a voice assistant. It’s a full AI ecosystem that grows with you:

- Listens and talks naturally  
- Understands context and remembers interactions  
- Plans tasks and schedules intelligently  
- Sees and interprets visual input  
- Automates system tasks  
- Runs on Desktop, Web, Mobile, and Robotics platforms  

> **Goal:** Make AI your personal productivity mentor, research assistant, and automation engine.

## 🔥 Features (Phase 1 – Current)

- Voice Interaction: Speak naturally; Friday listens and responds  
- Wake Word Detection: “Hey Friday” activates the assistant  
- AI Brain: Powered by large language models (LLMs) for intelligent answers  
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) & Speech Recognition (STT)  
- Modular Architecture: Easy to extend with memory, vision, and automation modules  

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview


- Voice Handler: Processes microphone input  
- AI Engine: Queries LLMs and generates intelligent responses  
- Memory Module: Remembers user context and preferences  
- Action Module: Executes tasks like opening apps, reminders, browser automation  
- Voice Output: Speaks back using TTS
